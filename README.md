Install dependencies in order to run the project. After that go to backend/server.js, line 15, and provide a database link. If the database is empty then you will need to make an account that will be stored in your database.

npm run dev to start up the server
npm start to start react

This browser game is inspired by old console Pokemon Games. You can make an account that will be stored in MongoDB and play using that account, as the project has both a front-end and a back-end. Users can log-in and log-out, and their progress is saved after each fight. The game uses a plethora of randomizers in order to have different fights, attacks and chances to capture other pokemons.
